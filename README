Hello!

I have recently developped an obsession with a type of dessert found in Québec, Canada: the galette. 

Historically, most types of food found in Québec can be traced to the nations who invaded the territory
a couple of hundred years ago: France and Great Britain. Even if traditional food from Québec is not
directly found in these nation, you can often see the roots of it. For example, meat pies are pretty common
in Québec and can also be found in British traditional cooking. 

Galettes (and obviously poutine) seem the be an exception. 

This projects aim to scrape data from a popular recipe website in Québec and find if maybe the origin of the
galette could be not from colonizing nations but from practicality. Were the galettes invented in Québec because
they used ingredients more readily available? Were the galettes invented because they require less precision
than say a cake maybe? 

These are the questions I am trying to answer. 

Currently, the project is incomplete. These are my planned steps:
- Find all recipe related to sibling deserts in a popular Québec recipe website (cakes, cookies and obviously
galettes) (done)
- Scrape the recipes (work in progress)
- Dockerize the scripts so they can run on Microsoft Azure (work in progress)
- Normalize the data
- Perform statistical analysis on the data
- Answer my question

Here are the steps you should follow in order to build the container (bear in mind, I am not finished with Docker
this WILL NOT work for now):
- setup a file in your project containing:
    - the full url to the database: DATABASE_URL=mysql+mysqlconnector://username:password@localhost:3306
    - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=yourPassword
    - MYSQL_DATABASE=recipeextractor
    - MYSQL_USER=recipe_scraper
    - MYSQL_PASSWORD=yourOtherPassword
- build your container using docker build -t containerName
- run your image using docker run --env-file=nameOfYourFile.env containerName
-
